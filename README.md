# Compass

Compass is a self-coaching application designed to empower users in taking charge of their mental health. By tracking and visualizing emotional states, Compass reveals patterns in mental and physical well-being, and provides actionable recommendations for improved self-awareness. The mission is to help people better understand and orient themselves on a personal level by quantifying and visualizing their emotions through journaling.
